///
/// This is the "Hey Siri" entry point that mirrors how third-party projects wake
/// the glasses workflow from Siri (e.g. a Siri Shortcut wrapping an App Intent).
/// Unlike `AskOpenGlassesIntent` — which only starts the microphone — this intent
/// carries the spoken text directly as a parameter, so the user never has to wait
/// for the in-app wake word:
///
///     "Hey Siri, ask OpenGlasses what's the weather"
///     "Hey Siri, ask OpenGlasses to summarize my last conversation"
///
/// If the question is omitted ("Hey Siri, ask OpenGlasses"), Siri prompts for it
/// via `requestValueDialog`. The answer flows back as a spoken dialog, so Siri —
/// not the app's internal TTS — reads it aloud (we pass `speakResponse: false`).
